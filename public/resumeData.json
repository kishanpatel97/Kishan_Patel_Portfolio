The corresponding dashboard UI fields were built using React.JS. I also had an opportunity to integrate a feature to Cisco’s IOx aPaaS framework in Python that allowed app images containerized via Docker and Kubernetes to be pulled from a public or private registry on several edge compute devices. The UI components on IOx were constructed in JavaScript for various application metrics such as app resource, lifecycle, and platform management. Upon successful completion of the features mentioned above, they were both presented to the Meraki and IOS-XE leadership teams respectively."

These trends were predicted using Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest machine learning models. For accuracy, recall, and F1 score, I was able to achieve 99% in Binary Classiﬁcation and 80% in Multi-Class Classiﬁcation."

I was able to automate the app's data logging in real-time by operating Google Firebase and constructing cloud functions in Node.JS on Google Cloud which subsequently saved the team 100+ hours of manual logging. I also helped support application development and began its initial deployment on the web by programming complex functions, procedures, triggers, and scripts in React/Redux. Furthermore, API requirements were defined using GraphQL and I collaborated with the Android and iOS developers in order to design a React Native component that logs the number of steps a user takes."
